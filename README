Instruction for developing this plugin.
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Setting_up_extension_development_environment)

1.- Create a profile for development in firefox
	- Windows: Start -> Run "%ProgramFiles%\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -no-remote -P dev
	- Linux: /usr/bin/firefox -no-remote -P dev
	The first time you run this command a window to create choose a profile will
	pop up. Click "Create profile" and create a profile with the name "dev".
	The next time you execute the command firefox will start using that profile.
2.- Modify browser preferences for development
	Type in the address bar "about:config". Not all preferences are defined by
	default, and are therefore not listed in about:config by default. You will
	have to create new (boolean) entries for them.
	And add or modify this preferences:
	javascript.options.showInConsole = true
	nglayout.debug.disable_xul_cache = true
	browser.dom.window.dump.enabled = true
	javascript.options.strict = true
	devtools.chrome.enabled = true
	extensions.logging.enabled = true
	nglayout.debug.disable_xul_fastload = true
	dom.report_all_js_exceptions = true
3.- Point to your development folder
	You can download the project, uncompress it, and place the folder where ever
	you feel confortable in your file system. (You can also download it via
	github if you want to contribute to the project)
	Go to your firefox profiles folder (Locations varies from OS) and open
	your dev folder the name will be something like u66sxcxw.dev, the "dev"
	is what you are looking for. Create a folder with the name "extensions" if
	it doesn't already exist. Create an empty file with the name
	"tntfixer@tntfixer.net". Add the file and add the complete path to the
	project folder.
4.- Restart firefox and start it with your dev profile (1).
